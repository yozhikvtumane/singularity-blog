According to the ESA, which spent the night trying to make sense of the Philae lander's strange docking maneuver, the lucky lander bounced off the surface of comet C-G no less than three times before finally settling down.

Philae first ricocheted off the comet immediately upon impact at 10:33 a.m. Eastern time. (As we reported yesterday, the lander's dual harpoons failed to eject and anchor it to the rocky comet) This initial bounce pushed Philae hundreds of feet into the air before the comet's weak gravity pulled it back in. Its next two (much gentler) bounces happened at 12:26 p.m. and finally at 12:33 p.m. Eastern, yet the hardy robot seems to be completely unharmed.

So where is it now? The ESA is trying to pin down Philae's exact coordinates, but we do know it's currently resting in the shadow of a giant cliff. See for yourself in this first picture from the lander (above).

Stephan Ulamet, the head ESA scientist in charge of the Philae lander, has just given a reassuring announcement. Despite the complications, Philae is sitting pretty on comet C-G and is already beaming back photos and data.

"Right now the lander is not anchored to the surface, and we're not sure if we have landed in a nice soft 'sandbox', or if something else is happening," Ulamet said in a briefing this afternoon. Whatever happened, Philae is on the ground, fully powered, and working perfectly. Phew.

While the ESA is still working on whether or not to re-fire the harpoons, the lander is now on the opposite side of C-G from Rosetta (over the horizon, so to speak). So any further decisions will have to be made tomorrow morning when Philae reestablishes contact.

Ulamet also hinted at something unexpected about Philae's surprising landing: with a cheeky smile, he noted "maybeâ€¦ maybe we didn't land once, we even landed twice! Some preliminary data has indicated that the lander may have lifted off again after it landed, started to turn itself, and touched down again."

We're sure to have more news tomorrow. For now, take a moment to enjoy ESA Director General Jean-Jacques Dordain's reassurance. "It's the right comet, don't worry. We have got a radio link, we have the power on board [the lander], and we have time. Now we just have to work."
